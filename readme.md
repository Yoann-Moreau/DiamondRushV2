# DiamondRushV2

DiamondRushV2 is the rewritten plugin developed by Hironak and heavily inspired by the plugin DiamondRush developed by 
aumgn and noogotte.

## DiamondRush mini-game

DiamondRush is a mini-game on Minecraft where teams of players must destroy all enemy totems to win the game.
The totems are made of obsidian and players rush to find diamond, so they can quickly mine the enemy totems.

After placing their totem and their spawn, teams find themselves in an exploration phase where PvP is disabled.
During this phase they can however gather resources to prepare for the combat phase and try to find the enemy totems.
Mining a totem can be done during any phase. If an enemy is close to your totem during an exploration phase, you can
send him back to his spawn with an attack.
During this phase messages in chat can only be seen by players on the same team. If you're using a voice chat system
it is recommended to have your teams in separate channels.

The combat phase follows the exploration one. During this phase, PvP is enabled and encouraged. A player killing an 
enemy player will receive a configurable reward. Messages in chat can be seen by everyone. In voice chat, it is 
recommended to have everyone in the same channel. 

Exploration and combat phases follow each other until all totems but one have been destroyed.
